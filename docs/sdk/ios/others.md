This describes the other funcionalities of the sdk.

## Fetch number of unread messages

You can get the number of pending messages to read in order to be able to display them whenever and wherever you want.

```swift
ðŸ‘¾
```

## Return intent **TODO** I think this don't be necessary

You can provide a return intent to redirect your app if you init a mediQuo SDK activity from a push or a deeplink.

```swift
ðŸ‘¾
```

## Tracking
If you would track SDK local events, add NotificationCenter observer for each Notification you want track:

| **Event name**            | **Params**                                      | **Type**                    | **Description**                                   |
