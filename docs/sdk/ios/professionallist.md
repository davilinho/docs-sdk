**TODO** description of how to integrate view

<kbd>
![Professional List](http://developer.mediquo.com/img/professional_list.jpg "Professional List")
</kbd>

<br/>
Create ProfessionalList, how to open or whatever other shit:

```swift
ðŸ’©
```
<br/>
**TODO**
We strongly recommend adding a _ProfessionalList Protocol_ for a better integration in your app.

<br/>
**TODO** Note: _swiftClickMethod_ allows you to control chat openings to suit your business logic.
_hasAccess_ indicates that the authenticated patient has access to the chats (has a _plan_ set via the [Patients API](http://developer.mediquo.com/docs/introduction/)).

```swift
ðŸ’©
```
